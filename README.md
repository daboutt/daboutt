## Hi there 👋

I'm Kevin, a frontend developer in Vietnam.<br>
I love building website whenever I have an weird idea. <br>
My main tech stack is React, Typescript, Redux, a little bit of framer motion, expressjs and currently studying Python!<br>
I've got some pinned projects, and my favorite is tomato-timer (I make it for my friends cuz I want she to be more focus lol)<br>

### Fun facts: 
- 🐕 I have a dog �
- ☕️ I'm a coffeholic 
- 🕵🏻‍♂️ I like playing guitar, reading books (Poirot is my fav)
