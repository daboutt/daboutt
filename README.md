## Hi there 👋

I'm Kevin, a frontend developer in Vietnam.\ 
I love building website whenever I have an weird idea. \
My main tech stack is React, Typescript, Redux, a little bit of framer motion, expressjs and currently studying Python!\
I've got some pinned projects, and my favorite is tomato-timer (I make it for my friends cuz I want she to be more focus lol)\

### Fun facts: 
- I have one dog.
- I'm a coffeholic
- I like playing guitar, reading books (Poirot is my fav)
